# Twitter Clone FrontEnd

For this part of the Twitter Clone project we will be creating the FrontEnd

# Setup



The FrontEnd setup is basically what you have been doing all 8 weeks, besides one caveat

We are going to install a package called Axios (and technically you do not need this package due to fetch)

Axios makes fetch requests a little easier.  Before fetch became standard in Javascript, people mainly Axios because it allowed for async function calls.

To install Axios do the following in the terminal

```console
> npm install axios
```

From there you can either use Expo Snack or other deployment options we have presented in class.
